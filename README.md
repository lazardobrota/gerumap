# Gerumap (MindMap)
<p>
  Application for creating simple mindmap. Person can draw cyrcles, color them, add text into them, connect multiple cyrcles with lines so relationships are established.
  Created MindMap can be zoomed in or out, exported and imported. You could also take a picture of it so you don't have to start application everytime you want to see your MindMap, its really nifty.
